### Description: 

This project is meant to test the OpenWeatherAPI. I have to test data that matches with the data gathered from the API using Postman as JSON. Postman allows me to check the data that is sent and delivered using this application and I can check the data using RAW, JSON and other types.

I can also check data by using the Unit Tests and seeing what has failed/passed in the list. 

### Prerequisites:
You will need the following software installed to be able to use the application:
- Postman
- Visual Studio 2019
